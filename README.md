- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sunshine-808
- 👀 I’m interested in joining in with any Python, Java, C# / C++ coding projects and engaging with the software development community.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python. I have experience with Julia, C++, and R as well
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Data science, data analysis, software development
- 📫 How to reach me: message me on here, or find me at a local coding event
